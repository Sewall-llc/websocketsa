Web Sockets for wi-spy
======================

This is a branch off of spectools for wi-spy spectrum analyzers.
I've created a new file called spectool_red. It builds a websocket version of 
spectool_raw that is compatible google chrome and IE

It requires tokyo cabinet library because we are including some datalogging as well even though 
the web interface for this is not complete yet.

Contact me at atlantageek@gmail.com if you use this.
