Web Sockets for wi-spy
======================

This is a branch off of spectools for wi-spy spectrum analyzers.
I've created a new file called spectool_red. It builds a websocket version of 
spectool_raw that is compatible google chrome and IE

It requires libwebsockets: http://libwebsockets.org/trac/libwebsockets

To build do the 

* ./configure
* make
* make install
